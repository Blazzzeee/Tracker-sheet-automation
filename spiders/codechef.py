        Instead of scraping the page source as-is, we want to load the page using
        a headless browser and wait for the page to render the content using
        JavaScript. We then wait for a specific element to appear on the page
        (in this case, a table with the class "dataTable"). Once the element
        appears, we yield the response to the `parse` method, which will then
        extract the desired information from the page.

        This approach is useful when the page uses a lot of JavaScript to load
        its content, and the page source does not contain the information we
        need.
